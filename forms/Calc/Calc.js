/*
Third program - create a program that uses a function to add two numbers from the user and return their sum to the main (calling) program.  
> scenario:
form named ‘calc’
function named ‘Calculate’ that takes 2 parameters named 'num1' and 'num2' and returns their sum to the main program
in the main program, gets 2 numbers from user and send them to the function
Note: remember to catch the answer that the function returns back to the main program
in the main program, outputs to console in this format:
        The sum of X and Y is Z.

let num1 = prompt("Introduce first number")
let num2 = prompt("Introduce second number")
let summedNumbers = sum(num1, num2)
function calculate(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
  };
  console.log(`The sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${summedNumbers}`)
